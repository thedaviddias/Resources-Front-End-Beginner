# Contributing guide
Want to contribute to move.it project? Awesome!
There are many ways you can contribute, see below.

## Opening issues

Open an issue to report bugs or to propose new features.

- Reporting bugs: describe the bug as clearly as you can, including steps to reproduce, what happened and what you were expecting to happen.

- Proposing features: explain the proposed feature, what it should do, why it is useful, how users should use it. Give us as much info as possible so it will be easier to discuss, access and implement the proposed feature. When you're unsure about a certain aspect of the feature, feel free to leave it open for others to discuss and find an appropriate solution.

## Proposing pull requests

Pull requests are very welcome. Note that if you are going to propose drastic changes, be sure to open an issue for discussion first, to make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it.

Fork the move.it repository, clone it locally and create a branch for your proposed bug fix or new feature. Avoid working directly on the master branch.
